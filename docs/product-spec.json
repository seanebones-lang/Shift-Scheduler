    "targetUsers": "Non-technical managers of small-to-medium service businesses (5-50 staff), e.g., cafes with high-volume walk-ins, spas with appointments, retail shops.",
    "valueProp": "Uses ML demand forecasting and constraint optimization to auto-generate optimal weekly schedules at 15-min granularity, minimizing labor costs (25-40% overtime reduction), ensuring >90% demand coverage, and promoting fair rotations—outperforming manual scheduling and tools like Deputy/Homebase. Freemium for <10 staff."
